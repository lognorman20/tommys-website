Thomas Endashaw is a rising star in comedy based in Los Angeles, known for conveying a unique perspective drawn from his own life through innovative social commentary and sharp act outs—all while keeping his material clean.

At just 22 years old, Thomas is currently the youngest performing comedian at The World Famous Comedy Store in Hollywood as a member of its storied Door Guy program, where he continues to hone his craft and build his name in the comedy scene. He began stand-up on a whim while studying the Business of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California. His Ethiopian immigrant parents have agreed to support this newfound "career" — as long as he finishes school.

Best known for making all kinds of crowds laugh—whether performing in packed clubs, college frat houses, church congregations, or backyard shows in South Central LA—Thomas brings rare versatility and authenticity to every stage he steps on. He has opened for national headliners such as Adam Ray and Kam Patterson, and is quickly earning a reputation as one of stand-up's most promising new voices.
